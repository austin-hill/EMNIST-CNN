# MNIST-Convolutional-Neural-Net
A convolutional neural network implemented in PyTorch that achieved a 99.57% classification accurracy on the MNIST dataset after 60 epochs of training, without expanding the dataset or using an ensemble of networks.
I included a checkpoint at the 99.57% accurracy.
# Requirements
PyTorch with CUDA, MNIST
