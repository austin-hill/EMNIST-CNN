# MNIST-Convolutional-Neural-Net
A convolutional neural network implemented in PyTorch that achieved a 99.62% peak classification accurracy on the MNIST dataset when I tested it, without expanding the dataset or using an ensemble of networks.
I included a checkpoint at the 99.62% accurracy.
# Requirements
PyTorch with CUDA, MNIST
